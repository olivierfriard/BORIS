__description__ = """
This plugin calculates Cohen's Kappa to measure inter-rater reliability between two observers who code categorical behaviors over time intervals.
Unlike the weighted version, this approach does not take into account the duration of the intervals.
Each segment of time is treated equally, regardless of how long it lasts.
This plugin does not take into account the modifiers.

How it works:

Time segmentation
The program identifies all the time boundaries (start and end points) used by both observers.
These boundaries are merged into a common timeline, which is then divided into a set of non-overlapping elementary intervals.

Assigning codes
For each elementary interval, the program determines which behavior was coded by each observer.

Comparison of codes
The program builds two parallel lists of behavior codes, one for each observer.
Each elementary interval is counted as one unit of observation, no matter how long the interval actually lasts.

Cohen's Kappa calculation
Using these two lists, the program computes Cohen's Kappa using the cohen_kappa_score function of the sklearn package.
(see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score.html for details)
This coefficient measures how much the observers agree on their coding, adjusted for the amount of agreement that would be expected by chance.
