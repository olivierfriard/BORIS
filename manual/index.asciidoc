== Introduction

This program is intended to log and analyze behaviours and events observed from a media file (audio / video) or in real-time.

== Install BORIS


BORIS is available for GNU/Linux, Microsoft-Windows and Mac OS X platforms at http://penelope.unito.it/boris.

BORIS requires the http://www.videolan.org/vlc/[VLC Media Player] from the VideoLAN Organization.
_VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework that plays most multimedia files as well as DVD, Audio CD, VCD, and various streaming protocols._


=== Linux

See instructions on the download page.


=== Mac OS X


==== Auto-install version

An Apple Disk Image (DMG package) is available for a quick install of BORIS and all its dependencies.

You can also run BORIS from sources. In this case you must first install the *Qt application framework* and *PySide - Python binding for Qt*.
See instructions on the download page.


=== Microsoft(TM)-Windows(R)

==== Auto-install version

Download the Microsoft(TM)-Windows(R) installer and follow the instructions.

If you have administrator privileges the program will install system-wide otherwise
 it will install in the Local Application directory.



==== Bundle version

Choose this version if you do not want to install BORIS but just use it.
 In this way, BORIS can also be launched from an USB key.



== Getting started

To begin to observe, you must first:

1) Create a new project

2) Configure the subjects (if any)

3) Configure the behaviours

4) Configure the independent variables (if any)





=== Creating a new project

The project is the container of all your data: coding scheme, observations and events.


To create the project choose the *File / New project* menu option. The *New project* window will open:

image::new_project1.png[]

You can set up your project, by inserting a project name, a date, a description
 and select your favorite time format. All these fields are not mandatory but may be useful to you.





=== Configurating subjects

You can add or remove a subject by using the *Add* and *Remove* buttons.


NOTE: The *key* field is not mandatory, you can live the cell empty. In this case
 the subject selection will be made only with the mouse (by double-clicking the subject row).

You can order the subject key alphabetically (by checking the *Alphabetical order* checkbox) or manually using the *Move up* and *Move down* buttons.

image::subjects_config.png[]

The behaviors can be imported from another BORIS project. Use the *Import subjects from a BORIS project* button.
If some subjects are already configured, the program will ask you for erasing them or appending the new ones.





=== Configurating behaviors

You can add a behavior by clicking the *Add behavior* button.
The program will ask you what type of event do you want to configure: a *State event*
 (event with duration) or a *Point event* (for short events).

image::behaviors_config.png[]

Then you must insert a *key* that will trigger the event recording and a unique *code*.

NOTE: If the *Key* field is repeated in more behaviors, the program
 will ask you during the observation to select the correct event to insert.

You can also input a *description* that will help you to remember the details of the behaviour.

You can set *modifiers* for the behaviour. In this case you must separate them by a comma:
----
self,others
----

Every time this event will be recorded, the program will ask you for the modifier.





In case of exclusion of events by *State events* use the *Exclusion matrix* utility
 to set up these exclusions:

* press the *Exclusion matrix* button
* Check events that are mutually exclusive

image::exclusion_matrix.png[]

The behaviors can be imported from another BORIS project. Use the *Import behaviors from a BORIS project* button.
If some behaviours are already configured, the program will ask you for erasing them or appending the new ones.







=== Configurating independent variables

You can add independent variables that will be asked to the user during the observation creation.

Variables can be of 2 types: *numeric* or *text* and can have a *Predefined value*.

image::independent_variables.png[]

The independent variables can be imported from another BORIS project. Use the *Import from project* button.




=== Saving your project


Once the project set up is done, press the *OK* button to create your project


The following window will appear, giving you access to the behaviors and subjects you configured before.

image::open_project.png[]

You can now save your project (*File / Save project* menu option)

All parameters are saved into a unique file in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON[JSON format]. 



=== Creating a new observation

Create an observation by selecting the *Observations / New observation* menu option

image::new_observation.png[]

You can set up your observation, by inserting an *Observation id* that must be unique (mandatory), the date of observation, a description and the independent variables
 (if you defined them in the project).

You can indicate a time offset that will be added to the video/audio position for the event insertion (negative value is allowed)


=== Media coding 


===== Selecting a media file

Use the *browse* button to select a media file. All media that will play with VLC are allowed.

IMPORTANT: The absolute path of your media will be saved in the file project. If the media are then moved you must reselect the correct position of your media before making a coding.
Your media are not saved into the BORIS project file!

You can enqueue more media in the first window #1.
In this case the media will be successively played and the event recording time will be the cumulative time along all the media.


===== Add a second video player to be played synchronously to the first one


You can add a second media file in the window #2. This media will be played synchronously to the first one. All operations (play, stop, jump...) will apply to the 2 media.


=== Live coding

If you want to code from living situation choose the second tab (*Live*).

image::live_observation.png[]


=== Start the observation


When your observation set up is done, click the *OK* button to proceed with the coding.


==== Media coding

The media will be played for one second and will be paused at the beginning.

image::open_observation_mw.png[height=700]

The various windows (*Configuration of behaviors*, *Subjects* and *Events*) can be undocked from the main window and repositioned on a convenient place on your desktop.


===== Play the media

The media can be controlled with the toolbar at the top of the main window.

image::toolbar.png[]


* Use *Space bar* to pause or play the video

* Use the *slider* below the media player to move into the media

* Use the image:playback_speed.png[] buttons to change the speed of video playback

* *Double-click on an event* in the *Events* window will seek the media X seconds before the event position.

See link:index.html#_time_offset_for_media_reposition[See parameters for setting the time offset]



* Use the *volume slider* to set the desired volume. Audio can be turn off by clicking on the speaker at left of the slider.


==== Live coding

Press the *Start live observation* button to begin to code.

image::live_coding.png[]



==== Recording an event

An event can be recorded in two ways:

* by pressing the key corresponding to the event (defined during behaviors configuration)
* by double-click on the row in the *Configuration of behaviors* window

The current behavior will be displayed above the video player, in the status bar and in the *Subjects* window.

image::config_behaviors_shadowed.png[]

IMPORTANT: If your *Events* window is undocked and if you want to use the keyboard for recording event remember that the *main window must be focused* (active).



==== Modifiers

If modifiers are defined in the behaviours configuration, the program will pause the media and ask you for the modifier.

image::modifiers_shadowed.png[]



If the pressed key corresponds to more events the program will ask you to choose the correct event.


image::various_events_shadowed.png[]



===== Selecting the focal subject

The focal subject can be selected in two ways:

* by pressing the key corresponding to the subject (if you defined any during subjects configuration)
* by double-click on the row in the *Subjects* window

The selected subject will be displayed above the video player and in the status bar:

image::statusbar.png[]

The focal subject is deselected with the same operation.

== Events

=== Editing an event

Event can be edited manually:

* Select the event to edit in the *Events* window
* select the *Observations / Edit event* menu option or right-click and select *Edit event* option

image::edit_event.png[]

You can edit all event parameters.

=== Adding an event

The option *Observations / Add event* allow you to add an event without using the behaviors configuration.




=== Exporting the events

The events from the current observation can be exported in a plain text file (tab separated values):

* *Observations / Export events*

The exported data can be imported with other analysis software.

The format is as below:

----
#Media file name	/home/user/Desktop/MOV001.MOD
#media total length	622.960000
#time	subject	code	type	modifier	comment
9.1	Foo	eat	START	tree leaf

181.2	Foo	eat	STOP	fruit	
192.1	Foo	charge	START		
196.3	Foo	charge	STOP		
----

Events can also be imported from a previous observation ( *Observations / Import events* ). The program will ask if you want to append events to existing ones or replace them.


== Manage observations

=== Open an observation

open

=== Edit an observation

edit

== Analysis

A raw time budget can be obtained from one or more observations (*Analysis / Time budget* menu option):

* Select the observations you want to analyze in the checkboxes list
* Select the subjects you want to analyze in the checkboxes list


image::time_budget_shadowed.png[]

The time budget data can be exported to a plain text file (in tab separated values format) in order to be further analyzed.



== Time diagram

An observation time diagram can be produced using the *Analysis / Visualize data* menu option.

image::diagram_shadowed.png[]

The diagram can be saved in SVG format.



== Program preferences

Some parameters can be modified by the user using the *File / Preferences* menu option.


==== Default project time format

Choose the default time format between *seconds* and *hh:mm:ss.s*


==== Automatic backup

An automatic backup can be activated. For this you must set the value between each backup in minutes (0 -> no backup).
During an observation BORIS will save your events in the project file automatically.

==== Fast forward/backward speed

Fix the number of seconds the program will jump into your media when fast tastes will be pressed.


==== Time offset for media repositioning after double-click on an event

Fix the number of seconds the media will be seeked before the event.


==== Play a beep everytime a key is pressed

Check the *Play sound when key pressed* checkbox.

==== Undock the media player

Uncheck the *Embed media player in main window* checkbox.

The program must be restarted
